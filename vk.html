        <h1 id="heading">The Soldier Who Became a Legend</h1>
        <p>Vikram Batra was an officer of Indian Army born on September 9, 1974, in Palampur, Himachal Pradesh.
           He got his primary education from his mother, and then went to DAV public school. He was known for his sport skills in school and also played table tennis at national level.
           At college, he joined the National cadet corps (NCC), and then began his journey to serve the nation.
           After Batra joined the India Military Academy, he was commissioned as a lieutenant.
           At the young age of 24, Batra lost his life in a battle of the Kargil War against Pakistan. He was posthumously awarded the prestigious Param Vir Chakra.
           KARGIL WAR, 1999 Batra's first posting was in the town of Sapore in Jammu and Kashmir's Baramulla district. He was in line to be shifted to Shahjahanpur in Uttar Pradesh.
           But then, came the 1999 war, and Batra was deployed in Kargil, Jammu and Kashmir.
           On June 19, Captain Batra's troop snatched point 5140 from right under Pakistan's nose during heavy shelling. This point was very important for Indian Army's victory in the war.
           In the early hours of July 7, he was commanding a mission to rescue an injured officer during which he pushed aside his Subedar, asking him to step aside because he has children.
           Moments after taking the Suberdar's place, Batra was killed.In his honour, the Indian Army uses his name in constructions and cantonments.
            
           THE FEARLESS HERO
            
            After capturing point 5140, Captain Vikram volunteered for the next mission to recapture point 4875, which was 17,000 feet above the sea level and 80 degree steep.
            He used the slogan "Ye dil maange more" to communicate mission successes.
            Batra was known in his regiment for his courage and valour. He was often referred to as "Sher Shah" in the intercepted messages of the Pakistan Army.
            In the 2003 movie, LOC Kargil, which was made as a tribute to the soldiers of the Kargil War, Abhishek Bachchan's character is said to have been based on Captain Batra
            He once said to a friend, "I'll either come back after raising the Indian flag in victory or return wrapped in it, but I will come for sure."
